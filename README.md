Silly bus driving arcade game.

WASD to move around.

This was my first project for MSSA. The last meaningful work I had done on it was October 31st or so, but the more it sits idle, the more I get agitated and want to improve upon it.

To Do List:
*Add UI indicators to kids.
*Fix music and sound.
*Completely re-do level design. Potentially create multiple, simple levels instead of the one that exists.
*Add cars on the road and simple AI to drive them around.
